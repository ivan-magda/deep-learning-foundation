# how_to_generate_video
This is the code for "How to Generate Video - Intro to Deep Learning #15' by Siraj Raval on YouTube


# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday April 27th at 12 PM PST

This weeks coding challenge is to use a GAN to generate some video! You can use Keras with a Tensorflow backend to do this.  The video will likely be blurry and that's ok, GANs are relatively new. 

Bonus points if 
* you manage to generate some video that is actually high quality. 
* you skip Keras and use plain Tensorflow


## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E2N1kQc8MM&feature=youtu.be) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree with Udacity. This code uses Keras with a Tensorflow backend to train a [Generative Adversarial Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=generative+adversarial+network&oq=gener&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61j69i60l2j69i59j69i61.547j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to generate new images of the [alien language](http://blog.wolfram.com/2017/01/31/analyzing-and-translating-an-alien-language-arrival-logograms-and-the-wolfram-language/) from the movie Arrival. We can stich those images together to create short videos as well.

## Dependencies

* tensorflow
* keras
* pillow 

Install missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

## Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` to see the code pop up in your default browser. 

Install jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if you don't have it.

## Credits

Credits go to [platers](https://github.com/platers) i've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
