# How to Simplify Your Data (LIVE) 


##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/K796Ae4gLlY) video on Youtube. We're going to use dimnensionality reduction to visualize our data. Specificially we'll build [Principal Component Analysis](https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/principal-component-analysis/) from scratch. Then, we'll compare it to 2 other techniqus (T-SNE, and LDA). Together, these are the 3 most popular DR techniques in machine learning right now.

##Dependencies

* numpy
* matplotlib

Install [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to run this and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for missing dependencies.

##Usage

In the main directory just typ `jupyter notebook` and this will run.

##Credits

Credits for this code go to [gbohner](https://github.com/gbohner). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
