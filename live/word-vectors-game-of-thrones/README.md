# word_vectors_game_of_thrones-LIVE
This is the code for the "How to Make Word Vectors from Game of Thrones (LIVE) " Siraj Raval on Youtube

##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY9EwZ02sXU) live session on youtube by Siraj Raval. We used 5 books in the [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) series to create a set of [word vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec). We'll use them to the find the similarity between words, map them out in 2D space, and analyze them.


##Dependencies

run `pip install -r pip-requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies. 


##Usage

The `demo.ipynb` has my commented code. The `Thrones2vec.ipynb` has the precompiled code, so you can see what the plots look like.


##Credits

Credits for this code go to [Yuriy Guts](https://github.com/YuriyGuts/). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
