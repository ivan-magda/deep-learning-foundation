# How_to_make_a_tensorflow_image_classifier_LIVE

##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APmF6qE3Vjc) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube. This Jupyter notebook shows step by step, the process of building a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow to classify [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) digits.

##Dependencies

* matplotlib
* tensorflow 
* numpy 
* scikit-learn
* math

install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). And install tensorflow via [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) link. 

##Usage

Once dependencies are installed run `jupyter notebook` in terminal to see the code in your browser. 

##Credits
